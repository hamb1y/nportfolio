Relay Console keeps SREs calm by pairing service health with narrative context. Every panel is a glass island fed by markdown descriptions that live in Decap.

**Highlights**

- Federated data fetchers with typed contracts.
- Hot-swap themes triggered by service posture.
- Collab cursors implemented with just 1.8kb of custom JS.
