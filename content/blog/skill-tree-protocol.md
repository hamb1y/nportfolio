Skill trees make expectations tangible. Each branch earns attention progressively, so nobody is shocked when we spend a quarter on infra polish versus shiny product moments.

My template:

- Define the narrative pillar ("Craft", "Systems", "Communication").
- Limit visible depth so people do not drown in boxes.
- Pair every node with a proof artifact: a doc, repo, or shipped feature.

Once teammates could "see" my map, mentorship chats stopped being therapy sessions and became roadmap pairings.
